These files are minified using [Grunt](#building-with-grunt).\n\n### Pickers\n\nThere are three picker files:\n\n* `picker.js` The core file (required before any other picker)\n* `picker.date.js` The date picker\n* `picker.time.js` The time picker\n\n_To support old browsers, namely IE8, **also include** the `legacy.js` file._\n\n\n### Themes\n\nAll themes are [generated using LESS](#less-styling) and compiled from the `lib/themes-source` folder into the `lib/themes` folder.\n\nThere are two themes:\n\n* `default.css` The default modal-style theme\n* `classic.css` The classic dropdown-style theme\n\nBased on the theme, pick the relevant picker styles:\n\n* `default.date.css` and `default.time.css` when using the default theme\n* `classic.date.css` and `classic.time.css` when using the classic theme\n\n__**__ For languages with text flowing from right-to-left, also include the `rtl.css` stylesheet.\n\n\n### Translations\n\nThe translations live in the `lib/translations` folder. There are currently [43 language translations](https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js/tree/master/lib/translations) included.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n## Building with Grunt\n\n[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) `~0.4.5` is used to build the project files. To get started, clone the project and then run:\n\n- `npm install` to get the required node modules.\n- `grunt test --verbose` to confirm you have all the dependencies.\n\n\nType out `grunt --help` to see a list of all the tasks available. The generally used tasks are:\n\n- `grunt develop` compiles the LESS files and watches for any source changes.\n- `grunt package` compiles and then minifies the source files.\n- `grunt test` tests the entire package.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n<a name=\"less-styling\"></a>\n## Styling with LESS\n\nThe picker themes are built using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) with Grunt. To customize the CSS output, read the `_variables.less` file in the `lib/themes-source` folder. You can specify:\n\n- colors for the theme,\n- sizes for the picker,\n- media-query breakpoints,\n- and a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\n\nMake sure to run the `grunt develop` task before making any changes to compile it into CSS.\n\n\n\n<br>\n## Versioning\n\nTo maintain consistency in the sort of changes to expect with version bumps, [Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/) is followed as closely as possible:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nConstructed as such:\n\n- `major`: breaks backward compatibility (resets the `minor` and `patch`)\n- `minor`: new additions with backward compatibility (resets the `patch`)\n- `patch`: bug fixes and misc changes\n\nIf a version bump is due, make sure to update the version with a project-wide search and replace.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n## Bugs\n\nBefore opening a new issue, please search the existing [Issues](https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js/issues) for anything similar – there might already be an answer to your problem.
